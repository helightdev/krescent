Events in Krescent are immutable facts that represent something that has happened in the system. They are the primary building blocks of Krescent's event-driven architecture.

## Base `Event` Class

All events in Krescent inherit from a base `Event` class. This class provides common functionality and a consistent structure for all events.

## `EventMetadata`

Every event carries metadata, which is encapsulated in the `EventMetadata` class. This metadata includes:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the event.
- **type**: The type of the event.
- **timestamp**: The time at which the event occurred.
- **position**: The position of the event in the event stream.

## Physical vs. Virtual Events

Krescent distinguishes between two main types of events:

- **Physical Events**: These represent actual occurrences in the system, such as a user action or a sensor reading.
- **`VirtualEvent`**: These are events that are derived or generated by the system itself, often as a result of processing physical events.

## `SystemEvent`

`SystemEvent`s are a special category of events used by Krescent for internal purposes. Some examples include:

- **`SystemStreamHeadEvent`**: Indicates the beginning of an event stream.
- **`SystemStreamTailEvent`**: Indicates the end of an event stream.
- **`SystemHintCommitTransactionEvent`**: Provides a hint to commit a transaction, often used in scenarios involving transactional event processing.

These system events help manage and coordinate the flow of events within Krescent.
